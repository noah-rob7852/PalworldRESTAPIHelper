# PalworldRESTAPIHelper


**PalworldRESTAPIHelper** is a Python module designed to simplify interaction with the Palworld REST API. It wraps common server commands such as retrieving server info, managing players, sending announcements, and controlling the server lifecycle.

**_When instantiating this class, you will need to specify 3 arguments:_**

**server_url** - The URL of the Rest API for the palworld server. Formatted like http://localhost:7000/v1/api

**server_admin_name** - usually "admin". 

server_admin_pass - The admin password for the server.



<h2>Features</h2>
- Fetch server info, metrics, and settings
- Get a list of connected players
- Send global announcements
- Kick, ban, and unban players
- Save the world state
- Gracefully or forcefully shut down the server
